      "content": "## Project Audit Assessment\n\n**Project**: GRANULES - Minimal multi-agent orchestrator using MCP\n**Version**: 1.0.17 (published to npm as @lbsa71/granules)\n\n### Status: COMPLETE\n\n**Code Quality:**\n- 90 tests passing across 7 test files\n- TypeScript with strict typing\n- Clean separation of concerns: store, server, orchestrator, worker, UI, session-log\n- MCP SDK integration with Zod schema validation\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Well-documented in ARCHITECTURE.md (515 lines)\n- Clear component boundaries: GranuleStore → MCP Server → Orchestrator → Workers\n- Git worktree isolation for concurrent workers\n- Atomic claim system prevents race conditions\n- Stale claim recovery (30min timeout)\n- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGINT handling\n\n**Documentation:**\n- README.md: Clear overview, quick start, project structure\n- ARCHITECTURE.md: Comprehensive system design document\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: Development workflow\n- docs/: 4 detailed reference documents (configuration, granule-flow, mcp-tools, worker-prompts)\n\n**Testing:**\n- store.test.ts (27 tests) - Core data operations\n- server.test.ts (19 tests) - MCP protocol integration\n- orchestrator.test.ts (13 tests) - Main loop logic\n- session-log.test.ts (13 tests) - Logging\n- file-store.test.ts (9 tests) - File persistence\n- index.test.ts (5 tests) - Entry point\n- worker.test.ts (4 tests) - Worker spawning\n\n**CI/CD:**\n- Automated tests and build on PRs and main pushes\n- Auto-publish to npm on main push\n\n**Minor Observations (not blocking):**\n- CLAUDE.md is minimal (single line about TDD) — could be expanded but works\n- No CONSTRAINTS.md or PROGRESS.md — these are planning artifacts, not needed for a complete project\n- No spec/ or domain/ directories — appropriate for a tool of this scope",

Minor findings: (1) unused `express`/`@types/express`/`supertest` dependencies in package.json, (2) `src/tools/` directory appears to be dead code, (3) ARCHITECTURE.md slightly stale (missing file-store.ts, constants.ts, prompts/ directory, incorrect test file count). All findings are low-severity housekeeping items. No blocking granules created. Updated AUDIT_REPORT.md merged to main."
